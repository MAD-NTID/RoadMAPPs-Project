## Overview (#Overview)

Due to explosive growth in the use of mobile computing devices, there has been an employment boom in the field of mobile application development, and the demand for new and innovative mobile apps is growing at an incredible speed.

The associate in applied science (AAS) degree in mobile application development prepares students for work in the software development industry with a focus on application design and development for mobile platforms. Mobile app development is a field that brings concepts in programming, web development, and interface design together. Using current and emerging technologies, students develop skills in application design, learn relevant programming languages used for application development on a variety of smart-devices, and learn the policies and procedures for submitting apps for distribution. This program is specifically focused on qualified deaf and hard of hearing students.

Courses cover multiple aspects of internet, mobile-related technologies, including programming languages and web markup, server side technologies and tools, mobile web development, responsive design, and application optimization for mobile devices.

Graduates of this program may work independently or with a team of programmers writing and developing software programs for mobile applications for contemporary devices. This requires skills in information gathering, user-centered design, effective deployment practices on a range of devices, and strong communication skills.

Mobile application development is available as AAS or as an Associate+Bachelor’s Degree Program.

The AAS degree in mobile application development, offered by RIT's National Technical Institute for the Deaf, is a career-focused degree program that leads to immediate entry into the workforce.

The Associate+Bachelor’s Degree Program in mobile application development prepares you to complete an RIT bachelor’s degree. You start with an AAS in mobile application development, which provides you with the foundational courses and credits you need to enroll in and successfully complete a bachelor's degree program in RIT's Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences. Upon completion of your AAS program, you will enroll in the Golisano College where you will complete a bachelor's degree in web and mobile computing.
