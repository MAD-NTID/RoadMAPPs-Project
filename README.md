## Overview

The Information and Computing Studies (ICS) department at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID), a college of Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), proposed a project designed to increase the number of deaf students pursuing IT-related careers through the development and implementation of an Associate of Applied Science Degree (AAS) in Mobile Application Development for deaf and hard-of-hearing students.

The project:

1. Included the development and implementation of curriculum that offers a unique, native, cross-platform approach to developing (mobile) apps;
2. Included ancillary activities that provide a _Learning Support Community_ (LSC) for deaf and hard-of-hearing (hereafter referred to as deaf) students with activities both in and out-of-class to increase peer support and enhance student-faculty and student-industry partner interactions, all leading to greater retention;
3. Was supported though strong advisory board/industry partnerships who reviewed the program, mentored students in LSC activities, provided capstone projects, offered cooperative (co-op) work experience opportunities, and assisted with full-time job placement;
4. Improved faculty skills in mobile application development through professional development activities; and
5. Created a pathway to the program for middle and high school students through career awareness and summer camp activities and dual credit courses.

## Intellectual Merit

The curriculum developed and implemented offered a unique, native, cross-platform approach. Although other colleges are offering programs in mobile apps development, this program introduced a native cross-platform approach that is especially appropriate for an associate degree program. Students learned  programming concepts and acquired the skills needed to create mobile apps that ran on multiple platforms without being overwhelmed by learning three different programming languages (one for each platform). The technical approach will also benefits the computing industry because it reduces the time required to publish an app on all platforms.

Students learned through instruction, hands-on exercises, labs, LSC activities, a capstone course where they designed and developed a publishable app and, finally, a cooperative work experience. Students have the opportunity to achieve C# and Xamarin certification, which are both standards in the field. The program content and educational strategies of the curriculum is appropriate for all students, whether hearing or deaf, and can be tailored for programs less than five (5) semesters. The curriculum itself can be used as the basis for developing educational standards in this content area in the future.

## Broader Impacts

The Mobile Applications Development program will not only increase the number of diverse workers in an emerging technology field, it will also broaden and sustain the participation of deaf workers in the global technological workforce. The skills attained will prepare deaf students for entry level employment as application developers, web/mobile designers and/or developers, and computer programmers.
